# [Ecosyste.ms: Archives](https://archives.ecosyste.ms)

An open API service for inspecting package archives and files from many open source software ecosystems.

## What is Archives?

Archives provides a unified HTTP API to explore the contents of package archives (tarballs, zip files, etc.) from various package registries without needing to download and extract them locally. It acts as a caching proxy that:

- **Lists files** within package archives from npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and other ecosystems
- **Fetches file contents** directly from archives without full downloads
- **Extracts metadata** like READMEs and changelogs from packages
- **Caches responses** to improve performance and reduce load on upstream registries

### Use Cases

- **Security scanning**: Inspect package contents for vulnerabilities without downloading
- **Documentation extraction**: Automatically fetch README files from packages
- **Dependency analysis**: Explore package structures and dependencies
- **Package validation**: Verify package contents match expectations
- **Research**: Analyze package ecosystems at scale

This project is part of [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms): Tools and open datasets to support, sustain, and secure critical digital infrastructure.

## API

Documentation for the REST API is available here: [https://archives.ecosyste.ms/docs](https://archives.ecosyste.ms/docs)

### Quick Start

The API accepts URLs to package archives as parameters. These URLs typically point to:
- npm package tarballs (e.g., from registry.npmjs.org)
- PyPI package wheels/tarballs (e.g., from files.pythonhosted.org)
- RubyGems .gem files (e.g., from rubygems.org)
- Other package archive formats (zip, tar.gz, etc.)

### Example API Calls

#### List files in an archive
```bash
GET /api/v1/archives/list?url=https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz

# Returns: JSON array of file paths in the archive
["package.json", "README.md", "lib/express.js", ...]
```

#### Get contents of a specific file
```bash
GET /api/v1/archives/contents?url=https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz&path=package.json

# Returns: JSON object with file contents
{
  "name": "package.json",
  "directory": false,
  "contents": "{\n  \"name\": \"express\",\n  \"version\": \"4.18.2\",\n  ..."
}
```

#### Extract README
```bash
GET /api/v1/archives/readme?url=https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.2.tgz

# Returns: README content in multiple formats (raw, HTML, plain text)
```

### Rate Limits

The default rate limit for the API is 5000/req per hour based on your IP address, get in contact if you need to to increase your rate limit.
